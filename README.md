<h4>The Real Virus</h4>

<p>   Some think that William Seward Burroughs was born. But I think he has always been. The essence of what we would later come to call Bill Burroughs was merely the darkest aspects of the primordial waste that spewed from the forming universe, and emerged as the corrupted soul of the human condition. Burroughs just is. The human incarntion, William S. Burroughs was born in 1914, the same year Archduke Franz Ferdinand is assasinated, sparking World War I; Babe Ruth marks his Major League debut with the Boston Red Sox, and the Panama Canal becomes official. The modern world was in full swing and change was roaring in the air. Burrounghs was born into the wealth of his grandfather's adding machine fame. Burroughs would go on to graduate from Harvard, do quick stint in the US Army, travel the world, and eventually land in New York in the 40s, where he would meet the men he would forever be associated with from then on: Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Herbert Hunke, Gregory Corso, and Byron Gysin&mdash;the Beat Generation. Burroughs went on to garner fame as an unapologetic homosexual junkie pederast, and he wrote extensively from inside that narrative for the wonderfully depraved to hold on to like a life raft in a sea of garbage literature.
  <br>
    His first acclaim was the book <i>Junkie: Confessions of an Unredeemed Drug Addict</i>. Considered wildly unpublishable, it didn't see the light of day until Burroughs dear friend and confidant, Allen Ginsberg was able to push it to his friend, for whom the epic poem <i>Howl</i> is written for, Carl Solomon. Ginsberg and Solomon met while institutionalized together at Columbia Presbyterian Psychological Institute in 1949. Solomon's father was the owner of Ace Books, who would go on to publish the book, at the behest of his son, through Ginsberg. Burrough's became most well known for his cut-up book, <i>Naked Lunch</i>. Burroughs went on publihs many more works, but if I write about naother one of them, I will quit freeCodeCamp all together, and it would be over arbitrary bullshit like particulars. So this is what you get... for now.

<blockquote>I am not one of those weak-spirited, sappy Americans who want to be liked by all the people around them. I donâ€™t care if people hate my guts; I assume most of them do. The important question is whether they are in a position to do anything about it. My affections, being concentrated over a few people, are not spread all over Hell in a vile attempt to placate sulky, worthless shits.</blockquote>-William S. Burroughs-
